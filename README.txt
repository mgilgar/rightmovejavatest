Please carefully read these instructions before attempting to write your solution.

This is an exercise to write some java code to read in a text file and answer three simple questions. 
The questions are at the bottom of this file. Once you have finished the exercise, please zip this directory and email it back to us. 
Please note that we:

* are looking for code that is written in a modular way that demonstrates thought about reusability, maintainability 
and your understanding of object oriented programming.

* are looking for you to showcase your code design skills, so feel free to create the necessary classes, avoid long procedural 
classes, overuse of static members, messy code, etc.

* have provided IntelliJ IDEA & Eclipse project files for your convenience, but you can ignore, delete or replace them.
